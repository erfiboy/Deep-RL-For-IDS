# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) in IoT Devices

This repository presents an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) designed for IoT devices, utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The system detects and classifies attacks on IoT networks and proactively mitigates threats with a reinforcement learning-based prevention mechanism.

## Features

- **Device Classification**: Classifies IoT devices using a Random Forest (RF) algorithm.
- **Attack Detection**: Detects intrusions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **Attack Identification**: Identifies attack types via the XGBoost model.
- **Proactive Threat Mitigation**: Utilizes Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning to mitigate attacks.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Machine Learning (Random Forest, CNN, XGBoost)
- Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG)
- Autoencoders for synthetic data generation
